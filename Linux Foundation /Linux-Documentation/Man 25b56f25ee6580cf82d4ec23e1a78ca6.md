# Man

# **man**

The **man** program searches, formats, and displays the information contained in the man page system. Because many topics have copious amounts of relevant information, output is piped through a pager program (such as **less**) to be viewed one page at a time. At the same time, the information is formatted for a good visual display.

A given topic may have multiple pages associated with it and there is a default order determining which one is displayed when no options or section number is specified. To list all pages on the topic, use the **-f** option. To list all pages that discuss a specific topic (even if the specified subject is not present in the name), use the **–k** option.

- **man –f** generates the same result as typing **whatis**.
- **man –k** generates the same result as typing **apropos**.

The default order is specified in **/etc/man_db.conf** and is roughly (but not exactly) in ascending numerical order by section.

# **Manual Chapters**

The man pages are divided into chapters numbered 1 through 9. In some cases, a letter is appended to the chapter number to identify a specific topic. For example, many pages describing part of the X Window API are in chapter **3X**.

The chapter number can be used to force man to display the page from a particular chapter. It is common to have multiple pages across multiple chapters with the same name, especially for names of library functions or system calls.
