# **Introduction to Networking**

A network is a group of computers and computing devices connected together through communication channels, such as cables or wireless media. The computers connected over a network may be located in the same geographical area or spread across the world. The connected devices are often termed ***nodes***.

A network is used to:

- Allow the connected devices to communicate with each other.
- Enable multiple users to share devices over the network, such as music and video servers, printers, and scanners.
- Share and manage information such as databases and file systems across computers easily.

Most organizations have both an internal network and an Internet connection for users to communicate with machines and people outside the organization. The **Internet** is the largest network in the world and can be called *"the network of networks"*.
