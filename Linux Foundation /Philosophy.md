## Foundation Event

in linux 85000 se jayda open source project aik jagah gather hote hai to collaborate and and share their idea ye usually yearly organize hota hai linux foundation event wo jagah hai jaha open source project maintainer milte hai aur apni skills show karte hai

this place is best to gain visibility in open source community isme ham foruming ke through durse logo se connect ho sakte hai jo open source me contribute kar rhe hai ya kar chuke hai

## Foundation Education

Linux foundation education group expert instructor aur expert open source developer ke sath work karta hai jo ki beginner level se lekar advance level tak course banane aur training dene me help karte hai

# Three Major Linux Distribution Families

### **The Red Hat Family**

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) heads the family that includes CentOS, CentOS Stream, Fedora and Oracle Linux.

Fedora has a close relationship with RHEL and contains significantly more software than Red Hat's enterprise version. One reason for this is that a diverse community is involved in building Fedora, with many contributors who do not work for Red Hat. Furthermore, it is used as a testing platform for future RHEL releases.

We will use CentOS Stream and CentOS more often for activities, demonstrations, and labs because there is no cost to the end user, and there is a longer release cycle than for Fedora (which releases a new version every six months or so).

The basic version of CentOS is also virtually identical to RHEL, the most popular Linux distribution in enterprise environments. However, CentOS 8 has no scheduled updates after 2021. The replacement is CentOS 8 Stream. The difference between the two versions is CentOS Stream gets updates **before** RHEL, while CentOS gets them **after**. For most purposes this matters very little and not at all for this course. While there are alternatives to CentOS Stream that look more like the older CentOS, for this course we find CentOS 8 Stream works just fine.

### **The SUSE Family**

The relationship between SUSE (SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, or SLES) and openSUSE is similar to the one described between RHEL, CentOS, and Fedora.

We use openSUSE as the reference distribution for the SUSE family, as it is available to end users at no cost. Because the two products are extremely similar, the material that covers openSUSE can typically be applied to SLES with few problems.

### **The Debian Family**

The Debian distribution is upstream for several other distributions, including Ubuntu. In turn, Ubuntu is upstream for Linux Mint and a number of other distributions. It is commonly used on both servers and desktop computers. Debian is a pure open source community project (not owned by any corporation) and has a strong focus on stability.

Debian provides by far the largest and most complete software repository to its users of any Linux distribution.

Ubuntu aims at providing a good compromise between long term stability and ease of use. Since Ubuntu gets most of its packages from Debian’s stable branch, it also has access to a very large software repository. For those reasons, we will use Ubuntu LTS (Long Term Support) as the reference to Debian family distributions for this course.

### **Key Facts About the Debian Family**

Some key facts about the Debian family are listed below:

- The Debian family is upstream for Ubuntu, and Ubuntu is upstream for Linux Mint and others.
- Kernel version 5.19 is used in Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
- It uses the DPKG-based APT package manager (using apt, apt-get, apt-cache, etc., which we cover in detail later) to install, update, and remove packages in the system.
- Ubuntu has been widely used for cloud deployments.
- While Ubuntu is built on top of Debian and is GNOME-based under the hood, it differs visually from the interface on standard Debian, as well as other distributions.

## Three Important Point About Linux

1. Things change in linux

linux me things and concepts change hote rehte hai ye is baat per depends nhi karta hai ki badlne wali chijo per kitna hard work kiya gya hai linux me constantly things change hoti rehti hai
