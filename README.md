linux is an open source kernel first operating system which is created based on unix by Linus Torvalds

- The **kernel** is the **core** of the OS â€” it manages:
  - Hardware (CPU, RAM, storage, network, etc.)
  - Processes (program execution)
  - File systems
  - Security & permissions
- A **Linux distribution** (distro) = Linux **kernel** + **software tools** + **package manager** + **desktop environment** (optional).
  Examples: **Ubuntu**, **Debian**, **Fedora**, **Arch Linux**, **Kali Linux**.
